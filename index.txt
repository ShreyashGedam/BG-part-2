1 - What is React? What are the advantages of using React?

React is a front-end and open-source JavaScript library which is useful in developing user interfaces specifically for applications with a single page. It is helpful in building complex and reusable user interface(UI) components of mobile and web applications as it follows the component-based approach.

The important features of React are:

- It supports server-side rendering.
- It will make use of the virtual DOM rather than real DOM (Data Object Model) as RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
- It follows unidirectional data binding or data flow.
- It uses reusable or composable UI components for developing the view.

MVC is generally abbreviated as Model View Controller.

- **Use of Virtual DOM to improve efficiency:** React uses virtual DOM to render the view. As the name suggests, virtual DOM is a virtual representation of the real DOM. Each time the data changes in a react app, a new virtual DOM gets created. Creating a virtual DOM is much faster than rendering the UI inside the browser. Therefore, with the use of virtual DOM, the efficiency of the app improves.
- **Gentle learning curve:** React has a gentle learning curve when compared to frameworks like Angular. Anyone with little knowledge of javascript can start building web applications using React.
- **SEO friendly:** React allows developers to develop engaging user interfaces that can be easily navigated in various search engines. It also allows server-side rendering, which boosts the SEO of an app.
- **Reusable components:** React uses component-based architecture for developing applications. Components are independent and reusable bits of code. These components can be shared across various applications having similar functionality. The re-use of components increases the pace of development.
- **Huge ecosystem of libraries to choose from:** React provides you with the freedom to choose the tools, libraries, and architecture for developing an application based on your requirement.

2 -  Creating react app from the official website.
    npx create-react-app my-app 
    Type the above in react to create a react app.
    my-app is the naem of the app . You can name it anything.

3 - Creating react app with vite - 
   npm creating vite.
   The ract app from the official website is very large around 350mb. While the one created with the vite is 
   only 60 mb and it reload faster.

4 - React file structure.
    This is the one which we create form the vite app.
    All the changes and files which we will be creting will be in the src folder.
    main.jsx and App.jsx are our main files.
    All the pages, components which we will be creting will be imported in the App.jsx.

    function App() {
    const { funcDecrement } = useContext(CartContext);

    return (
        <div>
        <Navbar />
        <Card />
        <button onClick={funcDecrement}>outsude button</button>
        </div>
    );
    }

    This is the structure of any component in the react application. All the js for the functionality will
    be written in the function before return. And all the html will be written in the return just like normal 
    HTML.

5 - React Component:

    - A React component is a more advanced and reusable piece of code composed of one or more React elements.
    - Components are the building blocks of a React application, and they can have their own state and lifecycle methods.
    - Components can be either functional or class-based.
    - They are reusable and modular, allowing you to organize your UI into independent and manageable pieces.

6 - Explain React state and props.

    In React, both state and props are fundamental concepts that allow you to manage and pass data within a 
    component-based architecture. They serve distinct purposes but are essential for building dynamic and 
    interactive user interfaces.

    State - 
    1. **Definition:**
    - The state is a JavaScript object that represents the internal data of a component. It is managed and controlled by the component itself.
    - Each component can have its own state, and changes to the state trigger a re-render of the component.
    2. **Updating State:**
        - State should be updated using the **`setState`** method to ensure React performs the necessary updates and triggers a re-render.
        - **`setState`** is asynchronous and can take a function to ensure that the previous state is considered when updating.

    Example of state - const [count,setCount] = useState(0)    

    State is local to the component where it is defined. It cannot be directly accessed or modified by other components.

    React Props - 
    Definition:
        Props (short for "properties") are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.
        Props are immutable, meaning that a child component cannot modify the values received via props.
    Passing Props:
        Parent components pass data to child components as attributes in JSX. For example:    
        <ChildComponent name="John" age={25} />
    Accessing Props:
        In a functional component, props are accessed as an argument:   
        function MyComponent(props) {
            return <p>{props.message}</p>;
        } 
    Top-Down Data Flow:
        - React follows a unidirectional data flow, where data is passed from parent components to child components through props.
        - Changes in the parent component trigger updates to the child components.

7 - What are the different phases of the component lifecycle?

    There are four different phases in the lifecycle of React component. They are:

- **Initialization:** During this phase, React component will prepare by setting up the default props
 and initial state for the upcoming tough journey.
- **Mounting:** Mounting refers to putting the elements into the browser DOM. Since React uses VirtualDOM,
 the entire browser DOM which has been currently rendered would not be refreshed. This phase includes the
  lifecycle methods `componentWillMount` and `componentDidMount`.
- **Updating:** In this phase, a component will be updated when there is a change in the state or props of a 
component. This phase will have lifecycle methods like `componentWillUpdate`, `shouldComponentUpdate`, `render`, 
and `componentDidUpdate`.
- **Unmounting:** In this last phase of the component lifecycle, the component will be removed from the DOM or 
will be unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase will have the lifecycle method named `componentWillUnmount`.

8 - Rendering lists in React
 
  It is just using arr.map to create component and rendeer it to dom. Reder the code to see the use of .map method
  to render a array in DOM.

9 - Event handeling in react.
    ex - onClick , onSubmit, and onKeyPress, 

const ClickExample = () => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    alert('Button clicked!');
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click Me
    </button>
  );
};

const SubmitExample = () => {
  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault(); 
    alert('Form submitted!');
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};

const KeyPressExample = () => {
  const handleKeyPress = (event) => {
    if (event.key === 'Enter') {
      alert('Enter key pressed!');
    }
  };

  return (
    <input type="text" onKeyPress={handleKeyPress} />
  );
};


10 - What are controlled vs uncontrolled components
Controlled Components - Controlled components are components that do not maintain their own state. Instead, 
the state is managed by React and passed down to the component via props. Like we use useState() to define them.

 uncontrolled components - States which are controlled by DOM itself are colled uncontrolled components.
 
 function handleSubmit(){
    console.log(window.email.value)
 }

 <form onSubmit = handleSubmit() >
    <input id = 'email'></input>
    <input type = "submit"></input>
</form>


11 - Explain useEffect()

The useEffect hook in React is a fundamental part of the React Hooks API, introduced in React 16.8. It allows you 
to perform side effects in functional components. Side effects include data fetching, setting up subscriptions,
 and manually changing the DOM. useEffect provides a way to manage these operations and ensures they are performed 
 correctly in the lifecycle of a component.

 useEffect(() => {
  // Your side effect code here.

  return () => {
    // Cleanup code here (optional).
  };
}, [dependencies]);

Effect Function: The first argument to useEffect is a function where you can put your side effect code. This 
function is executed after the render is committed to the screen.

Cleanup Function: This function is called whenever the component is unmounted from the DOM.

Dependencies Array: The second argument to useEffect is an array of dependencies. The effect will only re-run 
if one of the dependencies has changed since the last render. If this array is empty ([]), the effect will only 
run once after the initial render. If omitted, the effect runs after every render.
